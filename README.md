# My Beautiful CV
A Spring Boot REST Backend to manage CV data like:
- personal data
- education
- working experience
- technology skills
- languages
- programming projects
- certifications

To run the application you only have to configure the mysql connection in mycv/src/main/resources/application.properties.

Next step is to add an Angular frontend.
